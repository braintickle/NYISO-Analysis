# NYISO Energy Data Pipeline & EDA Dashboard

---

## Overview

This project builds a **production-style data pipeline** that ingests live data from the [NYISO public CSV API](https://www.nyiso.com/custom-reports), cleans and stores it locally, and surfaces insights through an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.


---

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date range covered | Jan–Mar 2024 (configurable) |
| Data freshness | Daily auto-refresh via GitHub Actions |
| Datasets ingested | Actual Load, Day-Ahead LMP, Fuel Mix |
| NYISO zones covered | All 11 zones |
| Storage format | Parquet (5–10x smaller than CSV) |

**Key findings from EDA:**
- NYC + Long Island account for ~46% of total system load
- Weekday load is consistently 10–15% higher than weekends
- Evening peak (6–8 PM) is the most predictable demand driver
- Natural gas sets the marginal price >60% of hours; LMP spikes correlate with heat events and transmission congestion

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nyiso-energy-pipeline.git
cd nyiso-energy-pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the EDA notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_eda.ipynb

# 3. Launch the dashboard (uses processed data from notebook)
streamlit run app/app.py
```

> **No API key required.** NYISO's CSV API is fully public.

## Data Sources

| Dataset | NYISO Name | Frequency | Description |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Actual Load | `pal` | Hourly | MW consumed per zone |
| Day-Ahead LMP | `damlbmp` | Hourly | Day-ahead electricity price ($/MWh) |
| Fuel Mix | `rtfuelmix` | 5-min | Generation MW by fuel type |

All data is fetched from `https://mis.nyiso.com/public/csv/`.

## Business Context

NYISO (New York Independent System Operator) manages the wholesale electricity grid for New York State — dispatching ~40 GW of capacity and settling ~$10B in annual transactions.

**Why this data matters:**
- **Load forecasting** is the #1 grid planning problem. A 1% MAPE improvement on a 25 GW system saves millions in reserve procurement.
- **LMP price prediction** drives trading, hedging, and demand response program design.
- **Fuel mix signals** are the real-time carbon intensity of the grid — increasingly used in ESG dashboards and demand flexibility programs.

This project is built from an M&V (Measurement & Verification) practitioner's perspective: the same load patterns that drive wholesale prices also determine the financial value of energy efficiency measures under IPMVP protocols.
